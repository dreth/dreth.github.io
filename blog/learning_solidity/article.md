My deep passion for cryptocurrency, and more specifically decentralized finance and blockchain applications has driven me to quit my job in January 2022 to pursue these interests from the engineering perspective rather than the hobbyist perspective.

It has become what I do every day during most of my free time for the past 3 years now. I can't stretch how profound my interest is and how bad I just want to understand everything.

Between January and May, I have taken small breaks that I had never taken before, relaxed for a bit and spent most of my days reading, researching, improving this website, adding little things to [defi.navy](https://defi.navy), learning cool little web development things and solidity.

This post will collect all the things I have so far learned about the solidity programming language with the intent to either develop applications in the future, find employment in the web3, develop my own applications or audit smart contracts. The path is not exactly clear to me yet, all I know is that *I want to learn*.
