# What I watch out for when considering investing in specific cryptocurrencies or tokens

I happen to really enjoy rolling around in the crypto world. I spend hours and hours researching, not to find specific answers to things, but because I think its _really fucking cool_. Given that many my friends and some acquaintances know how much time I spent researching, I often get asked the question **How do you determine a project is probably a good investment?**. Yesterday, I had a cool conversation about life with my friend CÃ©sar, who phrased this question in a way that gave me a great idea... _write an article about it!_. So here we are again, talking about crypto stuff.

As any human, aside from objective research I've made, I have my own biases and opinions, and like everyone else does, I also apply these to my investment choices. So the answer to the question of **what YOU should invest in** is a question only you can answer. All I'll do in this article is point to resources and details to watch out when investing on crypto projects, because I've heard far too many times the sentence _"Hey i found this really **good** project, you should check it out!"_, and then I check it out and it's just like any other project of its type. Competition is incredibly aggressive and fast on the crypto space, _almost everything_ (more on this later) is open source software, anyone can fork anything and improve it or change it.

## Some disclaimers

A few disclaimers I must make before jumping right into it:

- This is **my** opinion, formulated from other people's opinions and lots... lots of reading. I am in no way, shape or form an authority on this, I simply speak from my personal experience, mistakes, successes and things I've read.

- I've been deeply interested in this world for the past 5 years and have seen lots and lots of disasters, scams, cool projects, as well as massive opportunities, some I've taken advantage of, others I've [almost cried](https://youtu.be/9GkVhgIeGJQ) over missing.
  
- The cryptocurrency market is very speculative, no hypothesis that I or anyone has about the fundamentals or functionality of an application or blockchain will necessarily be reflected on the price. 

- Any investment that you make as a direct cause of reading this article is NOT my responsibility, this is risk that YOU and only YOU take.

- If you think all of cryptocurrency is a ponzi scheme or a huge scam, I recommend you read [the following article](https://divethru.com/feeling-stupid-a-guide-to-your-emotions/).

- I am a risk-averse investor, I do not engage with especially obscure projects, and if so I only put a small portion of my portfolio there.

## Purpose

There's projects for all sorts of things, but you must first identify what _the purpose_ of that project is. There's so many different projects out there, so let's try to bundle them and categorize them into a few different sections and provide some examples per category:

- **Payment blockchains** (Ex. Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash, Nano)
  - Private payment blockchains (Ex. Monero, Zcash)
  
- **Smart contract blockchains** 
  - EVM and EVM-compatible (Ex. Ethereum, Fantom, Gnosis Chain)
  - Non-EVM (Ex. Cardano, Polkadot, Solana, Terra)
  - Rollups (Ex. Arbitrum, Optimism, Metis, Boba)
  - ZK-Rollups (Ex. zkSync, Polygon Hermez)

- **Financial applications**
  - Decentralized exchanges (Ex. Curve, Uniswap)
  - Lending protocols (Ex. AAVE, Compound)
  - Cross-chain and multi-chain asset protocols (Ex. REN, WBTC)
  - Staking protocols (Ex. Lido, StakeWise)
  - Cross-chain/cross-rollup bridges (Ex. Multichain, Hop)
  - NFT gaming (Ex. Axie, Gods Unchained)
  - CDP protocols (Ex. Maker, Abracadabra)
  - Derivatives (Ex. Mirror, Synthetix)
  - Yield (Ex. Convex, Tokemak)
  - Dashboards/asset management (Ex. Instadapp, Defisaver)
  - Lotteries/savings (Ex. Pooltogether)
  - Indexes (Ex. Set protocol, Enzyme)
  - Privacy (Ex. Tornado, Aztec)
**... etc..**

- **Other types of projects**
  - VPN (Ex. Orchid)
  - Network provider for IOT systems (Ex. Helium)
  - Storage (Ex. Filecoin, Sia)
**... etc..**

Each one of these categories will have their own specific criteria to consider. I'll focus on the top three, payment blockchains, smart contract blockchains and apps.

## Questions applicable to any crypto project

Some questions I ask myself that I think apply to every crypto project:

- Is the project **open source**?
  
- Is its token **useful**?

- Is its token **necessary**? If the project didn't have a token, would it impede them from achieving the goal or functionality of the application?

- Does the token provide any yield or **dividends to holders**?

- How are the project's **tokenomics**? 

- How's the **vesting schedule**? How long will it take for the token's supply to be fully diluted?

- **Who** are the people behind this project? Are they anonymous? 

- Do the owners/developers have a **good track record**? Have they been part of some kind of scam in the past?

- How do the project's **git repositories** look like?

- Is the project **forked** from another successful (or unsuccessful) project?

- Is the token source code **identical** to that of a previous scam? Is the token vulnerable to any **previously discovered vulnerability** that any pas project has suffered?

### Open source vs Closed source

In the non-blockchain world of software, it's OK to use closed source software if it's coming from a trusted source. Sure, it's safer to use open source software, as you can actually _see_ what the piece of software is doing, however, on the blockchain this is **not optional**.

Blockchain applications and blockchains themselves *must* be open source, as they are constantly interacting with users' wallets/funds and any action the user performs when interacting with the blockchain or application is **irreversible**.

The purpose of blockchains is to remove the middleman, to avoid requiring trust. If you go and use an application on the blockchain or a blockchain that requires trust to use, you're exposing yourself to catastrophic financial loss, as unlike with traditional software on your computer, you're still able to stop software as long as you never allow it to have administrative privileges. On the blockchain, after you sign a transaction and the transaction is confirmed/included in a block, **you are never going to be able to reverse it or cancel it**.

### Token utility

Apps and blockchains alike sometimes need a cryptocurrency or token to thrive, encourage growth, govern the protocol, or any sort of utility. However, other times, the token is _basically useless_ or simply not necessary to have. This is (IMO) the first thing to consider when buying a token or investing in a project.

### Tokenomics

Tokenomics are perhaps the top 2 consideration to have when investing in a specific cryptocurrency or token. These are how the token is distributed, how much will users/the community get, how much the investors and developers get, how long it'll take for the token supply to be fully diluted, etc.

Good token
