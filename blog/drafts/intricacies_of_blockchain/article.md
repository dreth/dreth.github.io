# Hey wifey

Thank you for the ring, I love you, it's fucking BEAUTIFUL.

Happy valentine's day, even though we were unable to be together today, it made me very happy to see you, as always. I hope we can do some cool things together this week.

I'm also waiting for your test results, everything's gonna be ok, no matter what. Even if there's an apocalypse at home, I'll be here always, all the time, I won't go anywhere and I'll protect you and do whatever I can to be there for you as much as possible. Fortunately this thursday I'm done with my ex-job, so things will be much calmer next week in that sense.

I miss you. I still think about our days together in december every day, it's often what I wake up thinking about, other times it's what I go to bed thinking about, and some days both apply. I really look forward to the next time we meet. It all feels a little all over the place now that I quit my job, but everything is possible and I need to be on top of things now and be at the top of my game in every possible aspect so I can put a ring on u asap OKK??

I hope now that we will have more time, things will be a little more chill. I love you so much, I can't wait to see you again ):

Also, what're these QR codes for????
