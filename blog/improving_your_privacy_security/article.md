# Measures to improve your online privacy and security

<div class="date">

In the past few years I've taken an interest in privacy/security. For many reasons, some due to the alarming levels of data collection we face from massive tech corporations like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook) or Amazon. Others due to the fact that I, like many other people, have had my (now deleted) Facebook account hacked once or twice in the past, maybe due to company negligence, like Facebook not securing their systems properly, or due to poor password management.

In this article I plan to explain some of the tools I've used to reduce such data collection as much as possible and within certain bounds. I want to do this in 3 levels, the lowest one being the weakest and with the most exposure to third party data collection, the next one with a bit more time investment but likely worth your time to greatly reduce such data collection, and the last one for those that are willing to actually spend hours to days to become as private and secure as they can, as well as some useful resources to go down the rabbit hole.

## Why should I care?

![shrug](assets/shrug.jpeg)

Past generations, like my grandparents or to some extent even my own parents, never had to worry about data collection. There wasn't tons of storage to go around to store as much data as possible, there were little to no highly efficient and powerful tools for data analysis, there was no extremely granular and specific targeted advertising, and there were no meaningful data breaches.

My generation and the ones to come are going to live with this problem. We're going to have tons of sensitive data leaked onto random data dumps online. We're going to have tons of advertising companies, retailers, tech companies, governments and countless entities trying to gather as much information as they can about us, either for profit, surveillance or targeted advertising. Some are going to have their personal images, secrets and conversations leaked online or to other people's phones. And we're going to have to teach our kids or younger siblings about the importance of privacy and security.

## Are you affected by data collection?

![forum post](assets/data_leak_forum_post.jpeg)

Most people are only ever indirectly affected by massive data collection, so most people don't care about it. I've had countless friends and family members tell me directly that they don't care about data collection at all, some have even told me "let them gather all the data they want, i don't care". My understanding for this reasoning is that they potentially hold the following beliefs:

1. They believe it is inevitable

2. They consider that any meaningful data has already been collected

3. They have "nothing to hide"

*To which I would answer*:

1. It is, to an extent, you can mitigate a lot of it by using privacy-friendly software, avoiding products/software whose entire economic model is the sale of collected user data to third parties, living in a more privacy-friendly jurisdiction, etc... 

2. There is always more data to collect, you are constantly creating new data when sending new messages, using search engines, browsing to new websites, watching new Netflix shows, listening to new songs on Spotify, buying new things on Amazon, paying for items at some retail store with your card, making calls, posting pictures, liking pictures, tapping on an app to open it, etc... The extent of possible and effective data collection nowadays is greatly underestimated by users.

3. The most **terrible** reason ever. Data privacy is not only something people with "things to hide" want. Extreme edge cases: Would you want your parent's home address and how much their net worth is to be in the possession of some dangerous individuals? Would you want pictures of your naked body that you sent your ex-partner posted as the headline of some newspaper? Would you like to receive SMS messages daily with death threats because your phone number was leaked in some random database? then you have enough "things to hide" to care about data privacy.

## Privacy is a right

![you're being watched](assets/dude_on_pc.jpeg)

The right to privacy is present in over 150 national constitutions. There's reasons governments used to at least pretend to care about it. In the past and at times in the present, governments or law enforcement would try to protect you against blatant violations of privacy. This notion somewhat changed when Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA and other government-owned intelligence agencies spying on US citizens and essentially the entire world through extensive backdoors, spyware and extensive surveillance campaigns.

Wikipedia has an [excellent article on the right to privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy) that I highly recommend reading if you're interested in the right to privacy, its history and how it's evolved over time.

I firmly hold the belief that privacy is a right and should remain a right. We should push back on any blatant attempt at taking away any of our basic rights and our right to privacy should *not* be the exception to this rule. Neither governments nor companies should ever be allowed to blatantly violate our right to privacy. Plenty of people advocate for this, but it is slowly becoming less and less of a priority for people, it's become a 'given' that our privacy will be violated, especially our digital privacy.

Sadly, we only care about our rights when they're violated or taken away from us. Governments and large companies are working hard to extract as much value as they can, and as long as your personal data is valuable, your privacy is at risk.

## Security is a must

![bad password](assets/bad_password.jpeg)

Your life is going to be increasingly digitalized, less pen and paper, less handwritten forms, less physical content consumed and more digital everything. Every single aspect of our lives is now digitalized for the sake of practicality, efficiency, order and predictability. Less people doing mundane tasks and more people doing complex tasks. Not just for the sake of privacy, but also for the sake of *predictability*. You don't want your day to be interrupted by a random account getting logged out because you used an easy password. You don't want your finances to be under threat because you were fooled by someone that seemed legit through a very sophisticated social engineering attack. You don't want your personal documents or family pictures to be in some random computer on the internet, in the possession of god knows who because some company you trusted used a knowingly weak piece of software to store them.

There's tools and good practices you can follow to avoid having personal data leaked, avoid getting hacked and have a more organized and secure digital life. You want to spend time doing *what you want to do* not having to run to fix some issue caused by a bad practice on your part, or by a bad practice from a third party company you entrusted with your data. Therefore you should strive to use services that respect your privacy and security, and where you're *a user of the product* and *you're not the product*.

Companies *don't care about your security* unless there's financial consequences for not protecting it. Usually, if you get hacked on an account with a short, predictable password, it's not the company's fault, so they won't always make sure your password is secure, it is **your job** to care about your security. Same applies to using sketchy services, random free VPNs or bad software.

## Measures and mitigations

Now that you hopefully care, let me give you 3 levels of measures to take.

### Level 1: minimal measures

This is the simplest set of measures I would recommend *everyone* to do in order to improve their online privacy and security.

### Level 2: strong measures

### Level 3: powerful measures
