# Links and information resources on the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Слава Україні!

I've been closely following the invasion and the conflict for a few years and I'm very sad about the escalation and full invasion. I've compiled some links and useful resources to keep up with the war.

Some of the links I share here may have extremely graphic content. I'll mark the links with the following emoji:

## Background

The invasion is an escalation following a tense situation that has been ongoing since 2014 but has a lot more background. The news' approach of saying that the escalation was caused by Ukraine wanting to join NATO is a gross oversimplification. Wikipedia has some great articles on the events previous to the war as well as some history:

### Not directly related but important events

- [Holodomor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor): The great famine of 1932-1933 where about 3.5 M people died in the Ukrainian SSR, it was a part of the wider [Soviet Famine of 1932-1933](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_famine_of_1932%E2%80%931933). This was a man-made famine, whether the intention was to suppress the independence movement or as a consequence of industralization is up to debate.

- [1954 transfer of Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_transfer_of_Crimea) to the Ukrainian SSR.

- [1991 Crimean sovereignty referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Crimean_sovereignty_referendum). Crimea is mostly comprised of mostly ethnic russians, with only about 1/4 of the population being ukrainians or crimean tatars. the region has always held a special status within Ukraine (since the transfer). The referendum led up to the creation of the [Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Autonomous_Soviet_Socialist_Republic). It was then succeeded by the [Autonomous Republic of Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Republic_of_Crimea) which held special status within Ukraine, like Kyiv.

### Events directly related in the timeline

- [2013 Euromaidan protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromaidan): protests in the independence square of Kyiv and several other parts of the country where the people of Ukraine demanded closer approach to the EU. The protests started because the Ukrainian government at the time (led by Viktor Yanukovych) suspended the signing of the [European Union–Ukraine Association Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union%E2%80%93Ukraine_Association_Agreement).

- [2014 Annexation of Crimea by Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation): where Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea after an [internationally unrecognized referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Crimean_status_referendum) on its status.

- [2014 Donbas status referendums for Luhansk and Donetsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Donbas_status_referendums) also ilegally held and led to the [War in Donbas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Donbas) between Russian-backed separatist groups and the Ukrainian military. Let's also consider that there's a chance these referendums could have represented the majority of the population, and that most inhabitants in these regions did want to join Russia, or not, I have not found proper non-biased statistical analysis and research on this myself. The Russian government probably also intentionally destabilized the region by funding the liberation armies.

- After some conflict and fighting there was a 2015 ceasefire and [Minsk protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk_agreements#Minsk_Protocol). The events in 2014 led to many international condemnation and widespread [sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War) as well. Though from anecdotal information I've received from some people from Donbas, the conflict was most certainly not stale after the ceasefire and Ukrainian forces continued clashing with Luhansk and Donetsk liberation armies in the disputed regions.

- The EU is highly dependent on [Russian natural gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_in_the_European_energy_sector) and oil imports. Additionally, Joe Biden's administration, being more climate-friendly (which is great but currently problematic) has also aggravated the situation and pricing of fossil fuels for the EU with his [environmental policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_policy_of_the_Joe_Biden_administration) largely suppressing the production of fossil fuels. Even halting imports from [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_policy_of_the_Joe_Biden_administration#Oil_and_gas_pipelines). This environmental policy, the reduction in natural gas extraction in the [Groningen gas field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groningen_gas_field#Production) among other things have possibly increased energy prices in all of Europe and caused the [2021-2022 energy crisis in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932022_global_energy_crisis#Europe).

- In 2019 Zelenskyy won the presidential election on a [Landslide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Ukrainian_presidential_election). His policy has been very [EU and NATO friendly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy#Foreign_policy), which Putin, considering his desire to keep influence in the region [did not like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine%E2%80%93NATO_relations#Russian_opposition_to_Ukrainian_NATO_membership).

- Latest events leading up to the eventual invasion (also has a background section): [2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932022_Russo-Ukrainian_crisis).

- Eventual invasion of Ukraine by Russia on [wednesday 24th February 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_invasion_of_the_Ukraine) ordered by Putin under 'denazification' pretexts, even though [Zelenskyy is literally a Jew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy#Early_life). This however does not mean there are no nazi groups in Ukraine, there's the [Azov Battalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Battalion) for example. There seems to exist some sort of internal identity conflict within Ukraine, where there's a lot of [nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_nationalism), but still plenty of [ethnic russians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians_in_Ukraine), around 18% of the total population, especially in the disputed regions, particularly Crimea (percentage wise).

### Some opinion on the timeline

Attempting to read between the lines and from my own conclusions, I do not think that what we hear in the news *"Russia invaded Ukraine because they're joining NATO"* is correct, yes the Russian government does not want Ukraine to join NATO, but that is most certainly not the reason why they invaded Ukraine.

I think partly there's potentially personal reasons why Putin wanted to invade Ukraine that I do not know, after all, Putin grew up in the Soviet Union and has been governing the Russian Federation for decades now, which may have granted him a different perspective on the power Russia 'could deserve'. Maybe Putin legitimately believes that Ukraine should be 'liberated'. Maybe the disputed regions in Donbas and Crimea really deserve self-determination and if they want to join the Russian Federation maybe they should be allowed to do that. 

Either way, there's many perspectives from which we could see the conflict. I don't think a full-scale invasion was needed and I don't think Putin would really represent the overwhelming majority of Russians if most of the media outlets weren't state-sponsored, and even then, I don't know if he does. The saddest aspect of the conflict is that there's civilians in the middle and according to anecdotal evidence showing that [not even some russian soldiers know why they're there and don't want to be there](https://mobile.twitter.com/hackingbutlegal/status/1500465032966062082?s=20&t=K_MOclhP2y4zi1LwGK89dg).

## Interactive maps

The following two interactive maps show war updates as they go:

## Status of each city

Wikipedia has a great article on the status of each city per oblast and raion linking to the main article of each city, showing what nation is holding them and what events pertaining to the cities are ongoing, whether that's a battle or a different type of event.

### Individual battles during the war

Wikipedia has a really good article on this as well:
